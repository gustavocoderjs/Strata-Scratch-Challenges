# Strata SQL Challenges

This repository contains a collection of SQL challenges designed to enhance your SQL skills and understanding of database management. The challenges focus on real-world scenarios and data manipulation techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `sql/`: This directory contains SQL scripts for various challenges.
  - `custumer-revenue-strata.sql`: A SQL script that calculates the total revenue from each customer in March 2019, including only active customers who made transactions during that month.
  - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the SQL challenges, explaining the purpose of the challenges and how to use the SQL files.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as temporary files or local configuration files.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SQL challenges, navigate to the `sql/` directory and open the relevant SQL file. You can run the SQL scripts using any compatible database management system.
