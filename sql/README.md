# SQL Challenges Documentation

This directory contains SQL scripts for various challenges related to data analysis and manipulation. Each script is designed to address specific business questions or scenarios using SQL queries.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these SQL challenges is to provide practical examples of how to use SQL for data analysis, focusing on real-world scenarios that can be encountered in business environments.

## Usage

To use the SQL scripts in this directory:

1. Ensure you have access to a PostgreSQL database.
2. Copy the SQL script you wish to execute.
3. Paste it into your SQL client or command line interface connected to your database.
4. Run the script to see the results.

## Challenges

- **desafio-strata.sql**: This script calculates the total revenue from each customer in March 2019, including only those customers who were active during that month (i.e., those who made at least one transaction).

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts to suit your own data analysis needs!
